# Architecture Overview

The transaction broadcaster service can be designed using a microservices architecture. It consists of the following components:

- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for incoming requests and performs initial validation and routing.
- Transaction Service: Handles the signing and broadcasting of transactions.
- Blockchain Node: Represents the EVM-compatible blockchain network to which transactions are broadcasted.
- Database: Stores the state of transactions and their statuses.
- Admin Interface: Provides an interface for admins to view and retry failed transactions.

### The overall flow of the system can be described as follows:

1. An internal service sends a request to the /broadcast_transaction endpoint of the API Gateway with the necessary parameters.
2. The API Gateway validates the request and forwards it to the Transaction Service.
3. The Transaction Service receives the request and performs the following steps:
4. Validates the request parameters, ensuring the presence of message_type and data.
5. Signs the provided data using a private key securely stored.
6. Generates a signed transaction.
7. Stores the transaction details in the database with an initial status of "pending".
8. Initiates the broadcast process by making an RPC request to the Blockchain Node.
9. Waits for the response from the Blockchain Node.
10. If the response from the Blockchain Node indicates a successful broadcast, the Transaction Service updates the transaction status in the database as "success".
11. If the response from the Blockchain Node indicates a failed broadcast, the Transaction Service updates the transaction status in the database as "failed".
12. The Admin Interface allows admins to view the list of transactions, including their statuses. It also provides a retry functionality to manually retry failed transactions.
13. With this architecture, we can ensure that transactions are processed, signed, and broadcasted effectively while providing visibility and control to administrators.

### Transaction Retry Mechanism

To handle transaction failures and automatic retries, the Transaction Service can implement a retry mechanism. When a transaction fails to broadcast, it is marked as "failed" in the database. The retry mechanism periodically checks for failed transactions and retries broadcasting them.

The retry mechanism can be implemented using a background worker or a scheduled job that runs at predefined intervals. It retrieves the failed transactions from the database and retries broadcasting them to the Blockchain Node. The number of retries can be limited to avoid an infinite retry loop. If a transaction still fails after the maximum retries, it can be marked as "permanently failed" or require manual intervention.

### Handling Blockchain Node Response Time

Since the response time of the Blockchain Node can vary, we need to handle delayed responses or non-responsive scenarios. To address this, the Transaction Service can implement a timeout mechanism when waiting for a response from the Blockchain Node. If the response is not received within the specified timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds), the transaction can be retried automatically.

It's important to handle network connectivity issues, node failures, or high network congestion scenarios where the Blockchain Node may respond with a failure code due to external factors. In such cases, retries can be performed based on an appropriate retry strategy to increase the chances of successful transaction broadcasting.

### Admin Interface for Retry

The Admin Interface provides an interface for administrators to view the list of transactions along with their statuses. It can be implemented as a web-based dashboard or a dedicated API. The interface should include features such as filtering, sorting, and pagination to handle large transaction volumes effectively. Additionally, it should provide a retry functionality to manually retry failed transactions.

When an admin triggers a retry for a failed transaction, the Admin Interface can send a request to the Transaction Service, specifying the transaction ID or other identifying information. The Transaction Service then retrieves the failed transaction from the database, applies the retry logic, and attempts to broadcast the transaction again.

The Admin Interface should also provide visibility into the status of retries and display relevant information such as retry count, last retry timestamp, and any errors encountered during the retry process.

### Data Storage

The database plays a crucial role in storing transaction details and their statuses. It can be a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on the specific requirements of the application. The database schema should include fields such as transaction ID, sender address, transaction data, signed transaction, status, timestamp, etc. Storing the transactions allows for auditing, tracking, and easy retrieval of transaction data.

### High Availability and Fault Tolerance

To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, the transaction broadcaster service should be deployed in a redundant and scalable manner. This can be achieved by:

- Deploying multiple instances of the service behind a load balancer to distribute the incoming requests and handle failures.
- Using a distributed database or implementing database replication to avoid single points of failure.
- Implementing proper monitoring and alerting systems to detect service failures or performance issues.
- Employing containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to simplify deployment, scaling, and management of the service.

These measures help ensure that the broadcaster service can handle unexpected restarts, scale based on demand, and provide uninterrupted transaction broadcasting functionality.
